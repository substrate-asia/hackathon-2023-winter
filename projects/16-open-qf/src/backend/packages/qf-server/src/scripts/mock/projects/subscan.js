  description: `## Overview

Subscan is an essential block explorer and analytics tool for the Polkadot network, providing valuable insights to the Polkadot community. However, the maintenance and operation of Subscan requires a significant investment of resources, including server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Therefore, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fee for Subscan from July to December 2022 from the Polkadot treasury to ensure its continuous operation and maintenance.

## Total

We believe that this reimbursement proposal will help to ensure the continuous operation and maintenance of Subscan, and benefit the growth and development of the Polkadot network. This time, we plan to apply for a total of 190,244 USD in Polkadot, the amount of DOT will be converted based on the EMA7 price on the day of the official submission.
